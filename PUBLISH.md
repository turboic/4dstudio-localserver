As the 'native editor' feature is close to completion, i was thinking about 
how to publish the local server needed for this feature. 

https://bitbucket.org/daqri1/4dstudio-localserver

This server should be publicly available to 4dstudio users wherever they are. 
Thus they can use it without asking us. We could opensource it as it 
contains nothing secret or non-obvious. It would be installable via npm, using
the usual commands.

As we ask people to install software on their computer for a web application,
the security will be a matter. Opensource would allow people to look at the 
source and likely reassure them about the security aspect.

all in all, i think opensourcing this would be good.
