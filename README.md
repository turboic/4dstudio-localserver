# How to implement it
- server in node.js
  - with express or not ?
  - without express is cleaner
  - with express may be easier
  - start with express, and remove it when all works
- the client need to know if the edition is completed
  - the client need to get the data back
- it needs to support 'any' editor
  - support unix/macosx one for now
  - support for $EDITOR ?
  - support of the editor cmdline customisation in server options

# How to publish it ?
- on daqri opensource github
- security is a matter, so transparency is key as we install on the local computer.
- npm to install it to be casual for normal user
- TODO ask yow-hann
